## Python best practices

There are some best practices to use before, during, and after writing code in Python language in order to make the code readable and create a standard across the industry

Here will be listed several of such practices:
* Create a Code Repository and Implement Version Control
* Create Readable Documentation

  In my project I use readmee and Docstrings

* Follow Style Guidelines

  For example: PEP8(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

*  Correct Broken Code Immediately
*  Use the PyPI Instead of Doing it Yourself
*  The Zen of Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
*  Use the Right Data Structures
*  Write Readable Code
  
  You should use line breaks and indent your code.
  
  Use naming conventions for identifiers- this makes it easier to understand the code.
  
  Use comments, and whitespaces around operators and assignments.
  
  Keep the maximum line length 79 characters.

*   Use Virtual Environments
*   Write Object-Oriented Code
*   Avoid importing everything from a package- this pollutes the global namespace and can cause clashes.
*   Don’t implement best practices from other languages.
*   Do not turn off error reporting during development- turn it off after it.
*   Don’t alter sys.path, use distutils for that.
